# prep

`install-prerequisites.sh` is a convenience script that prepares your environment to compile remacs for supported platforms (ubuntu, fedora core). 
Unfortunately, over time the prerequisites may change. It's usually clear what's missing when running `configure` and -- with some investigation and experimentation -- 
how to fix it. Running this script just gives you a head start. YMMV.
